Easy Wordpress Error Logs

A wordpress plugin that allows you to easily create your error log file and view your wordpress errors. Once a day it will shift your log file into a logs directory under root and datestamp it. This keeps the error files small and easier to manage.

== Changelog ==

= 3.0 =

* Removed Tom M8te dependency.

= 2.3 =

* I've noticed that if the log is really large it can crash the site. This release only shows the first 900 characters of a line in the error log. If your log shows more then 900 characters in a line, I guess go to the actual log itself using FTP, to read the whole log.

* In admin display logs in correct order.

= 2.1 =

* Only change htaccess log error file if the file doesn't exist.
